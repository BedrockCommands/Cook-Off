# Bedrock Commands Community Public License (BCC-PL) v1.0

**Plain-language summary (non-binding):**  
- **Code** is under the MIT License — you can freely use, share, or commercialize it.  
- **Creative Assets** (builds, textures, models, sounds, music, art, etc.) are under this License (BCC-PL).  
    - You may **remix and share Derivative Works**, as long as you preserve attribution and include this License.  
    - You may **not redistribute the unmodified Project** — only the Project Licensing Representative (PLR) can do that through Official Channels.  
    - You may **not commercialize Creative Assets** without Explicit Permission from the PLR.  
- **Content creation (e.g., YouTube, streams)** is allowed and may be monetized, as long as you credit “Bedrock Commands Community”.
- This summary is provided for convenience only. The full License governs all use of the Project.

## 1. Purpose

This License distinguishes clearly between two categories of content:

- **Code-Based Elements** (scripts, functions, and logic) are licensed solely under the MIT License and may be freely used, modified, redistributed, or commercialized in accordance with that license.  
- **Creative Assets** (all non-code assets such as builds, textures, models, sounds, and structures) are licensed under this License (BCC-PL). These may be used and remixed, but are subject to restrictions on redistribution and commercialization set out below.

This License ensures that Creative Assets released through the Bedrock Commands Community Discord’s Annual Map Making Program remain open for public use and modification, while commercial uses of Creative Assets are managed solely by the Project Licensing Representative. This section explains the intent of the License and is not itself a condition of the License.

## 2. Definitions

- **2.1 “Project”**  
    - (a) Refers to any designated GitHub repository under the `@BedrockCommands` organization that has been explicitly included in the Bedrock Commands Community’s Annual Map Making Program, as indicated in the repository README or description by the Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff.  
    - (b) The Project includes both:
        - (i) **Code-Based Elements** (as defined under 2.2); and
        - (ii) **Creative Assets** (as defined under 2.3). 
    - (c) The Project covers all such content whether distributed in source form or packaged into alternate formats such as `.zip`, `.mcworld`, or any other format shared via Discord, Minecraft Marketplace, or successor platforms.  
    - (d) For avoidance of doubt, the Project includes both individual Contributions and the collective assembly of Contributions, including any related versions, derivative works, or distributions.  
    - **Informal explanation (non-binding)** For everyday players, “the Project” simply means *the map (including its code and creative assets), in whatever form it is downloaded or obtained*.

- **2.2 “Code-Based Elements”**
    - (a) Means solely the set of scripts, functions, logic modules, and other programmable or executable content.
    - (b) **License:** All Code-Based Elements shall include an [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) header and are licensed to downstream users under the MIT License.

- **2.3 “Creative Assets”**
    - (a) Means all non-code assets—such as audio files, visual files, model geometry files, world files, and structure files—that are intended for artistic, design, or sensory purposes. This category includes:
        - All files within the `models/`, `textures/`, `sounds/`, `structures/`, or `music/` directories.
        - Any other creative, design, or art-oriented files integrated into the Project that fall outside of Code-Based Elements.
    - (b) **License:** Creative Assets are licensed to downstream users under this License (BCC-PL), with the BCC-PL header included where technically feasible.

- **2.4 “Bedrock Commands Community Discord” or “BCC”**
    - Refers to the informal online community hosted on Discord, at the server with ID `924894457894174740`, which collaboratively organizes and contributes to the Project via the GitHub organization `@BedrockCommands`. The term is used solely for purposes of attribution and community identity. It does not represent a legal entity and holds no ownership, enforcement rights, or responsibilities under this License.

- **2.5 “Project Licensing Representative” or "PLR"**
    - (a) Refers to the individual currently authorized to manage all rights and legal matters for the Project, initially designated as the Discord user `@.zruby` (`711962234431078490`). All legal authority for licensing, enforcement, and intellectual property management under this License is exercised by the Project Licensing Representative on behalf of all Contributors, pursuant to mutual agreement as formalized in the [BCC Contributor License Agreement (BCC-CLA)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-cla-v1.0).
    - (b) In the event the Project Licensing Representative can no longer act, they may designate a successor in writing. Such successor shall assume all rights and obligations under this License.

- **2.6 “Contributor”**
    - Refers exclusively to any individual recognized as a Contributor under the [BCC Contributor License Agreement (BCC-CLA)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-cla-v1.0), which includes those who have digitally signed the CLA and whose Contributions (whether Code-Based Elements, Creative Assets, or other material) have been formally submitted via pull request and merged by the Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff.

- **2.7 “Contribution”**  
    - (a) Any original work of authorship submitted by a Contributor to the Project, as recognized under the [BCC Contributor License Agreement (BCC-CLA)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-cla-v1.0).  
    - (b) This includes, but is not limited to, **Creative Assets** and **Code-Based Elements**.  
    - (c) Contributions must be formally submitted (e.g., via pull request) and accepted by the Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff to qualify.


- **2.8 “Derivative Work”**
    - Refers to any work based upon, incorporating, or adapting elements of the Project that includes sufficient creative expression to constitute a new work of authorship under the copyright laws of England and Wales. Purely trivial or de minimis modifications (e.g., renaming files, reordering data, or replacing blocks without substantial transformation) shall not qualify as a Derivative Work under this License.

- **2.9 “Explicit Permission”**
    - Written authorization—either signed or otherwise electronically confirmed—by the Project Licensing Representative that specifically permits a particular use otherwise prohibited under this License (BCC-PL), the [BCC Contributor License Agreement (BCC-CLA)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-cla-v1.0), or both. Requests for Explicit Permission must be sent to **bedrockcommandscommunity@gmail.com** or the current contacts provided on the Project’s official channels. The Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff may respond within thirty (30) calendar days; failure to respond does not imply permission.

- **2.10 "Authorized Staff"**
    - Any BCC project director, coordinator, department lead, or moderator appointed by the Project Licensing Representative to act on their behalf under this License, as expressly designated through verifiable Discord role assignments in the Bedrock Commands Community Discord (Server ID: `924894457894174740`).
