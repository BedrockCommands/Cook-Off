## 1. Definitions

- **1.1 “Contribution”**
    - (a) Any original work of authorship submitted by the Contributor to the Project, whether created independently or as a modification, adaptation, or addition to an existing Contribution, including but not limited to:
        - **(i) Minecraft-specific files**: `.mcworld`, `.mcstructure`, `.mcfunction`, and other content for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
        - **(ii) Code-Based Elements** (as defined under 1.2).
        - **(iii) Creative Assets** (as defined under 1.3).
        - (iv) Any other files or content submitted to the Project.
    - (b) Contributions are only recognized as such under this Agreement once formally submitted via a pull request and merged into the designated Project repository by the Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff.
    - (c) Contributor grants license upon submission, regardless of acceptance; but obligations attach only upon merge.
    - (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Contributions do not include proprietary content provided by Mojang/Microsoft with Minecraft (e.g., default textures, sounds, models, or sample pack files), unless and only to the extent that such use is expressly permitted under the Minecraft EULA or official modding guidelines.

- **1.2 “Code-Based Elements”**
    - (a) Means solely the set of scripts, functions, logic modules, and other programmable or executable content.
    - (b) **License:** All Code-Based Elements shall include an [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) header and are licensed to downstream users under the MIT License.

- **1.3 “Creative Assets”**
    - (a) Means all non-code assets—such as audio files, visual files, model geometry files, world files, and structure files—that are intended for artistic, design, or sensory purposes. This category includes:
        - (i) All files within the `models/`, `textures/`, `sounds/`, `structures/`, or `music/` directories.
        - (ii) Any other creative, design, or art-oriented files integrated into the Project that fall outside of Code-Based Elements.
    - (b) **License:** Creative Assets are licensed to downstream users under the [BCC Public License (BCC-PL)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0), with the BCC-PL header included where technically feasible.

- **1.4 “Contributor”**
    - (a) The individual natural person who submits one or more Contributions to the Project and has digitally signed this Agreement through CLA Assistant for GitHub.
    - (b) The Contributor must have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements.
    - (c) If the Contributor is under the age of majority in their jurisdiction, this Agreement is not enforceable unless a parent or legal guardian co-signs or otherwise provides verifiable consent in writing.
    - (d) Where a Contributor is a minor, the parent or legal guardian providing consent agrees to be fully bound by all obligations, representations, and warranties of this Agreement, and assumes all liabilities for the minor’s Contributions as if they were the Contributor themselves.
    - (e) If a Contributor is a minor and fails to provide valid parental or guardian consent, the Project Licensing Representative may reject the Contribution, and for that Contributor only, this Agreement shall have no effect. The validity and enforceability of all other Contributors’ agreements shall remain unaffected.

- **1.5 “Project Licensing Representative” or "PLR"**
    - (a) The individual (acting in their personal capacity, not as agent of any entity) authorized to manage all legal and licensing matters for the Project on behalf of all Contributors. Initially designated as **[insert_legal_full_name]** (Discord: `@.zruby`, ID: `711962234431078490`).
    - (b) In the event the Project Licensing Representative can no longer act, they may designate a successor in writing.  
        - (i) Such successor shall assume all rights and obligations under this Agreement and the [BCC Public License (BCC-PL)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0), **provided that Contributors are notified in writing of the successor and may object within thirty (30) calendar days of such notice**.  
        - (ii) Absent any objection within this period, the successor is deemed accepted by all Contributors.

- **1.6 “Authorized Staff”**
    - Any BCC project director, coordinator, department lead, or moderator appointed by the Project Licensing Representative to act on their behalf under this Agreement, as expressly designated through verifiable Discord role assignments in the Bedrock Commands Community Discord (Server ID: `924894457894174740`).

- **1.7 “Bedrock Commands Community” or “BCC”**
    - Refers to the informal online community hosted on Discord, at the server with ID `924894457894174740`, which collaboratively organizes and contributes to the Project via the GitHub organization `@BedrockCommands`. The term is used solely for purposes of attribution and community identity. It does not represent a legal entity and holds no ownership, enforcement rights, or responsibilities under this Agreement or the [BCC Public License (BCC-PL)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0).

- **1.8 “Project”**
    - (a) Refers to any designated GitHub repository under the `@BedrockCommands` organization that has been explicitly included in the Bedrock Commands Community’s Annual Map Making Program, as indicated in the repository README or description by the Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff.  
    - (b) The Project includes both:
        - **Code-Based Elements** (as defined under 1.2); and
        - **Creative Assets**, (as defined under 1.3).  
    - (c) The Project covers all such content whether distributed in source form or packaged into alternate formats such as `.zip`, `.mcworld`, or any other format shared via Discord, Minecraft Marketplace, or successor platforms.  
    - (d) For avoidance of doubt, the Project includes both individual Contributions and the collective assembly of Contributions, including any related versions, derivative works, or distributions.

    - Written authorization—either signed or otherwise electronically confirmed—by the Project Licensing Representative that specifically permits a particular use otherwise prohibited under this Agreement, the [BCC Public License](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0), or both. Requests for Explicit Permission must be sent to **bedrockcommandscommunity@gmail.com** or the current contacts provided on the Project’s official channels. The Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff may respond within thirty (30) calendar days; failure to respond does not imply permission.

- **1.10 “Derivative Work”**
    - Refers to any work based upon, incorporating, or adapting elements of the Project that includes sufficient creative expression to constitute a new work of authorship under the copyright laws of England and Wales. Purely trivial or de minimis modifications (e.g., renaming files, reordering data, or replacing blocks without substantial transformation) shall not qualify as a Derivative Work under this Agreement.

## 2. License Grant

- **2.1 Grant of Rights**
    - The Contributor grants the Project Licensing Representative an **irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable, and transferable license** to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, distribute, publicly display, sublicense, commercialize, and otherwise exploit their Contributions.

- **2.2 Retained Rights**
    - The Contributor retains ownership of Contributions which are solely their own and may independently use, license, or commercialize it in isolation from the Project or other Contributors' content, subject to the terms of the [BCC Public License (BCC-PL)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0) for Creative Assets, and subject to the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) for Code-Based Elements respectively.

- **2.3 Contribution Withdrawal**  
    - (a) Withdrawal requests must be made in good faith and not for the purpose of harassment, sabotage, or to otherwise interfere unreasonably with the Project’s development or distribution.  
    - (b) Withdrawal does not entitle the Contributor to any form of compensation, damages, or reimbursement for past, current, or future uses of the Contribution.  
    - (c) Contributor may request withdrawal of a Contribution via written notice to the Project Licensing Representative within seven (7) calendar days of being merged. During this period, the license grant under Section 2.1 shall remain subject to revocation.
    - (d) After the seven (7) day period:  
        - (i) The license becomes irrevocable;  
        - (ii) Withdrawal is only permitted if:  
            - The Contribution contains malicious code;  
            - The Contribution materially infringes third-party copyright;  
            - The Contribution includes personal data in violation of UK GDPR or applicable data-protection laws; or  
            - Withdrawal is otherwise granted at the sole discretion of the Project Licensing Representative, provided that no withdrawal shall be granted if the Contribution has been materially integrated into a public release.  
        - (iii) If permitted, the Project Licensing Representative or Authorized Staff will make reasonable efforts to:  
            - Remove the Contribution from future Project versions;  
            - Update public repositories within ninety (90) calendar days.  
        - (iv) A permitted withdrawal shall not affect:  
            - Licenses for already distributed Project versions;  
            - Integrated portions in Derivative Works;  
            - Sublicensed third-party uses.

- **2.4 Attribution**
    - **2.4.1 Project Attribution (All Contributors).** The Project Licensing Representative will make reasonable efforts to provide appropriate credit to all Contributors for their Contributions, whether Code-Based Elements or Creative Assets, within the official releases of the Project. This credit may be given by GitHub username or another preferred identifier and may be provided:
        - **(a) In-game**, such as through signs, books, chat messages, user interface elements, or where practical; and/or
        - **(b) In the README File** or other credit documentation of the Project.
    - **2.4.2 Downstream Attribution Obligations.** The Contributor acknowledges that the mechanism for enforcing attribution on downstream users differs based on the type of Contribution:
        - **(a) For Code-Based Elements:** Code is licensed to downstream users under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). The sole attribution obligation for downstream users is to preserve the copyright and license notices within the source files. The Project's commitment to in-game or README credit under 2.4.1 is an internal policy and does not create an additional enforceable condition on the MIT License for downstream users.
        - **(b) For Creative Assets:** Assets are licensed to downstream users under the [BCC Public License (BCC-PL)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0). Public users are bound solely by the conditions of the BCC-PL. Contractual attribution obligations will only apply to third-party publishers or distributors (such as a Minecraft Marketplace Partner) who enter into a separate sublicense or agreement with the Project Licensing Representative.
    - **2.4.3 Limitations on Liability.** The Project Licensing Representative and Authorized Staff shall not be held liable for any failure of a third-party licensee to comply with their attribution obligations. Contributors agree to direct any claims regarding a third party's failure to provide attribution solely against that non-compliant third party.
    - **2.4.4 Scope.** The Contributor understands and agrees that the attribution rights under 2.4.1:
        - **(a) Apply only to publicly released versions** of the Project; and
        - (b) Do not apply during development, testing, or pre-release phases.
    - Contributors acknowledge that attribution may be displayed in aggregate or collective form.
    - **2.4.5 Correction of Omissions.** In the event of a material omission of credit in a public release, the Project Licensing Representative will issue a corrective update within a commercially reasonable timeframe, not exceeding thirty (30) days upon receiving verified written notice.

- **2.5 Moral Rights**
    - To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Contributor irrevocably:  
        - (a) **Consents** to all modifications, adaptations, and uses of the Contribution as authorized under this Agreement;  
        - (b) **Acknowledges** that the Contribution may be edited, combined, fragmented, adapted, or used in contexts unforeseen by the Contributor; and  
        - (c) **Covenants not to assert, and expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by law,** any moral rights (other than the right of attribution preserved under Section 2.4) against the Project Licensing Representative, Authorized Staff, or any sublicensee with respect to such authorized uses.

- **2.6 Enforcement Authority**
    - (a) The Contributor authorizes the Project Licensing Representative, and any duly appointed successor or Authorized Staff, to enforce the rights granted under this Agreement and the [BCC Public License (BCC-PL)](https://bedrockcommands.org/legal/bcc-pl-v1.0) on behalf of all Contributors collectively.  
    - (b) Such authority includes initiating or settling legal proceedings, issuing takedown requests, and otherwise acting in respect of Contributions and the Project as a whole.  
    - (c) This enforcement authority is non-exclusive. Contributors retain the right to enforce their own Contributions independently, provided that doing so does not conflict with the Project Licensing Representative’s actions or decisions.  
    - (d) Where a Contributor wishes to enforce independently, they shall notify the Project Licensing Representative in writing and allow a reasonable opportunity (not less than 30 calendar days) for the Project Licensing Representative to take action before proceeding.
